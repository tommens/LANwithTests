# LANwithTests
This is a simple example of a token ring Local Area Network, implemented in Java 8 with with JUnit 4 unit tests. The example is used for teaching purposes only in the context of a Software Evolution and a Software Engineering course at the University of Mons. This repository should therefore not be considered as a "real" software project in any way, although it is intended to represent some (not all) good practices. Some key concepts that are targeted to be illustrated by the code and the commit history are: unit testing, test coverage, refactoring, quality analysis and quality improvement, design patterns.
